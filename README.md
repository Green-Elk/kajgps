## Purpose of kaj**foto** ##

Testing how to make änöther change - commit and push at the same time

kaj**foto** is directed at users who at times feel **more productive at the command level** than when constrained by having to use the mouse.

For any OS X 10.6+ users: kaj**foto** enables you to

1. manage backup hard disks (**mirrors**, which may be offsite)
    * **list differences** between directories (on main HD and on mirror)
        * create batches of "cp" commands for fixing mismatches
    * identify and remove **unintentionally redundant** files
        * create batches of "rm" commands for pre-meditated, careful removing of them
2. report **statistics by directory tree**, by filetype, by year etc., in pretty-formatted HTML
    * identify high file counts, **high disk usage**
    * verify that files are **where you expect** them to be
    * create a **mental picture** of your harddisk
    * enable you to get **a sense of order**, well-founded in reality
3. **find files** by simple or complex criteria, quicker than with `find` or `locate`
